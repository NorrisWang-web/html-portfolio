    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I have lived and worked in Japan for over 10 years doing jobs that primarily required English and Japanese language skills.<br />
      It's perfectly viable for some people who just want to work and live in Japan to just do work teaching English.<br />
      Some who develop really good Japanese skills might move on to translation or office worker jobs that want foreigners for some specific role.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to expand my skills and break out of this cycle of relying solely on English to find employment, I decided to learn to code.<br />
      I've tried learning to code from HTML and had successfully learned the basics going on to CSS and JavaScript.<br />
      Unfortunately, I never got to the point of breaking past that wall to get a good-looking portfolio up and finding employment.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      It's not easy trying to kickstart a career in Japan in your 30s in an industry you have no previous working experience in, but I'm not backing down.<br />
      Despite multiple attempts to try and learn to code, I dug in and left my job to push myself to find a job in the Japan IT industry as I learned to code again.<br />
      I'm still inexperienced, but I'm going to prove I can get the job done.<br />
