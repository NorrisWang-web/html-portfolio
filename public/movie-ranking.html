    <h1>Streamed Movie Rankings</h1>
    <h2>Watched By Norris in 2023</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>I know these movies have been around but there are so many good movies that have already been around that I haven't watched.</p>

    <h3>Schindler's List</h3>
    <p>An award-winning classic by Steven Spielberg I finally got around to watching.</p>

    <h3>Joker</h3>
    <p>Not a Batman movie but tells a very human version of an origin story of one of the most iconic villains that Batman fights</p>

    <h3>IT</h3>
    <p>I didn't watch the first TV movie adaptation or read the books, but I really liked Stephen King's horror story that follows the Losers from childhood to adulthood.</p>
